This is an app I built for myself to manage fantasy leagues for RuPaul's Drag Race. I took over from a friend in [Season 17]({{ site.data.seasons.page_dir }}/17/). At the time, it was run out of Google Sheets. I found it was a bit of a pain to manage and maintain, so for fun, I decided to build this app before [Season 18]({{ site.data.seasons.page_dir }}/18/). In doing so, I discovered multiple scoring errors I made in Season 17 (none that changed the outcome!) and was easily able to test out a couple different sets of rules and scenarios for Season 18.

All of the source code for how I run the league and build the website is publically available on [Github]({{ site.data.urls.repo }}). If you like what you see, you can [buy me a coffee]({{ site.data.urls.coffee }}). If you have any feature requests or notice any bugs, please open an issue on Github.

There's probably a way to generalize this to arbitrary fantasy leagues (for competition/reality TV or otherwise) that use two sets of rules for scoring, but I haven't taken the time to think that through yet.
