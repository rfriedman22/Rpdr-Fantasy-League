## Scoring

There are two ways to earn points: the **performance** of your team and the **rank** of each queen.

### Performances

Each week, you gain or lose points when the following things happen to your team member:

| Event                   |   Point Value |
|:------------------------|--------------:|
| Tops                    |            25 |
| Win Main Challenge      |            30 |
| Bottoms                 |           -15 |
| Lip Sync For Your Life  |           -15 |
| Lip Sync Winner         |            10 |
| Win Mini Challenge      |            15 |
| Double Sashay           |           -30 |
| Double Shantay          |            30 |
| Runway Malfunction      |           -15 |
| Wig Reveal              |            15 |
| Lip Sync Malfunction    |           -15 |
| Miss Congeniality       |           100 |
| Wins Lip Sync Smackdown |            60 |

Points have 2 times greater value for your captain.

The Tops and Bottoms of the week are determined based on who gets critiqued. This is usually six queens, but near the end of the show it will be fewer.

In a lip sync smackdown, points are earned each time a queen wins a lip sync, but no points are deducted for a queen being eliminated from the bracket.

### Ranks

Based on how a queen ranks, they will earn a select number of points. Those points will be multiplied by the point value of the rank assigned in the team selection.

**Note:** This scoring system assumes a final four and no double sashays. In a final four, third and fourth place are worth the same. The teammate you think will be runner-up is worth slightly more than the third teammate. Rules will be adjusted if needed.

|   Rank |   Worth of the Team |   Worth of the Queen |
|-------:|--------------------:|---------------------:|
|      1 |                  25 |                   25 |
|      2 |                  15 |                   15 |
|      3 |                  14 |                   13 |
|      4 |                  12 |                   13 |
|      5 |                  10 |                   10 |
|      6 |                   9 |                    9 |
|      7 |                   8 |                    8 |
|      8 |                   7 |                    7 |
|      9 |                   6 |                    6 |
|     10 |                   5 |                    5 |
|     11 |                   4 |                    4 |
|     12 |                   3 |                    3 |
|     13 |                   2 |                    2 |
|     14 |                   1 |                    1 |

#### Example

- Team 1 ranks Jinkx 12th
- Team 2 ranks Jinkx 5th
- Team 3 ranks Jinkx as their captain

Jinkx finishes in 4th, so she is worth 13 points. Then:

- Team 1 earns 3 x 13 = 39 points
- Team 2 earns 10 x 13 = 130 points
- Team 3 earns 25 x 13 = 325 points
