## Scoring

There are two ways to earn points: the **performance** of your team and the **rank** of each queen.

### Performances

Each week, you gain or lose points when the following things happen to your team member:

| Event                   |   Point Value |
|:------------------------|--------------:|
| Tops                    |            25 |
| Win Main Challenge      |            30 |
| Bottoms                 |           -15 |
| Lip Sync For Your Life  |           -15 |
| Lip Sync Winner         |            10 |
| Win Mini Challenge      |            15 |
| Double Sashay           |           -30 |
| Double Shantay          |            30 |
| Runway Malfunction      |           -15 |
| Wig Reveal              |            15 |
| Lip Sync Malfunction    |           -15 |
| Miss Congeniality       |           100 |
| Wins Lip Sync Smackdown |            60 |

Points have 2 times greater value for your captain.

In a lip sync smackdown, points are earned each time a queen wins a lip sync, but no points are deducted for a queen being eliminated from the bracket.

### Ranks

Based on how a queen ranks, they will earn a select number of points. Those points will be multiplied by the point value of the rank assigned in the team selection.

**Note:** This scoring system assumes a final four and no double sashays. In a final four, third and fourth place are worth the same. The teammate you think will be runner-up is worth slightly more than the third teammate. Rules will be adjusted if needed.

|   Rank |   Worth of the Team |   Worth of the Queen |
|-------:|--------------------:|---------------------:|
|      1 |                  25 |                   25 |
|      2 |                  15 |                   15 |
|      3 |                  14 |                   13 |
|      4 |                  12 |                   13 |
|      5 |                  10 |                   10 |
|      6 |                   9 |                    9 |
|      7 |                   8 |                    8 |
|      8 |                   7 |                    7 |
|      9 |                   6 |                    6 |
|     10 |                   5 |                    5 |
|     11 |                   4 |                    4 |
|     12 |                   3 |                    3 |
|     13 |                   2 |                    2 |
|     14 |                   1 |                    1 |

#### Example

- Team 1 ranks Jinkx 12th
- Team 2 ranks Jinkx 5th
- Team 3 ranks Jinkx as their captain

Jinkx finishes in 4th, so she is worth 13 points. Then:

- Team 1 earns 3 x 13 = 39 points
- Team 2 earns 10 x 13 = 130 points
- Team 3 earns 25 x 13 = 325 points


**Scoring will be updated here as the season progresses.**
